          <h3>DNA Anomalies</h3>
          <p><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone with specific concerns regarding the recent alleged DNA anomalies should contact the AHAA Federal Secretary, Helen Clutterbuck.</span></p>
          
          <h3>Service Certificates</h3>
          <p>It is no longer required for stallion owners to send in the white copy of the Service Certificate with their Stud Service Return for their own mares listed.</p>
          
          <p>They will be required to send in the white copy for any outside mares listed on the Stud Service Return and these mare owners must receive a blue copy to send in with the application for foal registration form. </p>
          
          <h3>Registration of Progeny from Imported Semen</h3>
          <p>Due to recent Federal Council rulings, the following paragragh has been inserted into the Registration section of the AHAA Rules &amp; Regulations. </p>
          
          <p>"A foal born in Australia as a result of the use of imported semen may be registered in the AHAA Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses after it has been inscribed in the official Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses of Spain.  Inscription proof needs to be provided in the form of copies of all relevant inscription documents officially signed as sighted by the Secretary of  AHAA or a JP.  The words "I certify this is a true and unaltered copy of the original" with a signature and date would be required to be written on each page of the inscription documents.  The documents need to show all relevant information for the horse to be registered including (but not limited to) date of birth, identification diagrams, pedigree information, microchip number and parent DNA compatability.  The foal will need to be DNA profiled with the AHAA so the AHAA has records for future parent validation."</p>
          
          <h3>Attention Mare Owners  </h3>
          <p>It has recently come to the attention of the AHAA that there are some owners of unregistered Andalusian stallions who are advertising their stallions for service.   Unfortunately, the offspring of these stallions would not be eligible for registration with the Andalusian Association of Australasia.  It is in the interest of mare owners to check that the stallion owner is in fact a registered breeder.  This is easily done by contacting the AHAA Secretary on 03 5263 3402.  Please do not leave yourself open to be disappointed when it comes to registering your beautiful foal.</p>
          
          <h3>Taking your mare to the stallion</h3>
          <p>Check the owner is a financial member of the AHAA and the stallion has been DNA tested and has results recorded with the AHAA, to ensure the progeny will be eligible for registration.  Check your costs with the studmaster first.  You will probably be asked to pay a booking/handling fee (non returnable, but deducted from the service fee), agistment and all veterinary fees.  If you choose to remove your mare from the stud before a pregnancy test can be carried out, you are liable to pay the service fee.  When you collect your mare, the studmaster must give you a duplicate service certificate and an "Application for Registration of Foal" form.  The stud may require your mare to be swabbed for infection transmittable diseases to the stallion, or you may prefer to have this done and have a current certificate from your vet.  If your mare is shod, remove the shoes before taking her to the stud.</p>
          
          <h3>Stallion Owners </h3>
          <p>Stallion owners must submit Stud Service Returns to the AHAA by 30th June of the season of service or by 31st July of the season of service with the appropriate late fee.  If Stud Service Returns are not submitted, resulting foals will not be eligible for registration.  Stud Service Returns will only be accepted from financial full members.</p>
          
          <h3>Studmasters</h3>
          <p>When accepting a mare to your stud, all markings, brands, microchip numbers and colours should be noted ON ARRIVAL as well as name, registration number etc.  It is essential that your service record is kept up to date.  If you wish to accept broken-coloured mares to your stallion, you must emphasise to the owner that the progeny are only eligible for registration in the ID Register.  You must fill out the Service Certificate in TRIPLICATE, the owner of the mare being given the DUPLICATE copy, plus an Application for registration form, the TRIPLICATE to be retained by the Stud for records.  Make sure your Service Certificate is properly dated and that white markings, whorls, brands/microchip number of the mare are correctly shown, as they will be checked and if they do not record with the mares markings, the progeny will not be accepted for registration.  Your Stud Service Return must be sent to the Secretary, properly completed, before June 30th each year, accompanied by the white service certificates for outside mares (service certificates not required for mares owned by the stallion owner) AND APPROPRIATE FEES.   Each mare served must be included whether tested positive or negative.  These mares should be recorded in your stud records, but should NOT be included on your Stud Service Return.</p>
          
          <h3>Registration</h3>
          <p>Registration will only be accepted from Full Financial Members of the Association.  Each application for registration shall be submitted on the prescribed form and shall contain all such information and documentation as required by the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>Each horse submitted for registration (excluding entry to the ID Register) must be the progeny of a Sire and/or Dam which are registered or eligible for registration at the date of application in the Stud Book of this Association or Stud Book or Register recognized by this Association.</p>
          
          <p>In respect of each horse (Pure Spanish, Purebred Iberian, Hispano-Arabe, Australian and Partbred) foaled in Australia, application for registration in the Stud Books or Register of the AHAA shall be submitted within TWELVE (12) MONTHS from foaling.  Members applying for late registration of foals must pay the late fee and all paperwork must be received at the office of the AHAA prior to 1st August of the year the foal turns 2 years.  Horses foaled in Australia and recorded in overseas stud books, but not with the AHAA before the age of two years, will be ineligible for registration with the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>REGISTRATION OF HORSES FOALED IN AUSTRALIA AFTER THE ABOVE DATE WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE AHAA UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
          
          <p>If an application for registration of a horse is not correct or is incomplete, that application shall be returned for the correct completion and re-submission within thirty (30) days, otherwise penalty fees become payable.</p>
          
          <p>In respect of each horse imported into Australasia, an application for registration in the Stud Book shall be made by it’s owner within sixty (60) days from it’s clearance from quarantine.  Each PRE horse so imported must provide Certificate of Registration from the country of origin, be DNA tested and meet all criteria required by the Council of the AHAA.  Each horse so imported may be inspected for the purpose of verification of identity by one or more inspectors appointed for that purpose by the Council.</p>
          
          <p>A foal born in Australia as a result of the use of imported semen may be registered in the AHAA Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses after it has been inscribed in the official Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses of Spain.  Inscription proof needs to be provided in the form of copies of all relevant inscription documents officially signed as sighted by the Secretary of  AHAA or a JP.  The words "I certify this is a true and unaltered copy of the original" with a signature and date would be required to be written on each page of the inscription documents.  The documents need to show all relevant information for the horse to be registered including (but not limited to) date of birth, identification diagrams, pedigree information, microchip number and parent DNA compatability.  The foal will need to be DNA profiled with the AHAA so the AHAA has records for future parent validation.</p>
          
          <p>Not withstanding anything contained herein, the Council may insist upon the inspection of any horse before accepting the application for registration in the Stud Book or Register and may appoint one or more inspectors for that purpose and the expense of the inspection shall be borne by the applicant for registration.</p>
          
          <p>A Certificate of Registration shall be issued in respect of each and every approved application for registration.</p>
          
          <p>Under no circumstances shall the Certificate of Registration be amended, endorsed or mutilated in any way.  The Certificate of Registration must be returned to the Association for any proper amendment or endorsement.</p>
          
          <p>In the event that a Certificate of Registration becomes lost or destroyed a duplicate may be requested.  An application for issue of Duplicate Certificate of Registration must be completed and forwarded to the Federal Secretary, together with the appropriate fee.  The information on this application form must correspond with the original foal application form.  Authorisation in writing must be received from the Registered Owner for the issue of a duplicate Certificate of Registration.  The applicant must be a full financial member of the Association.  Upon correct information and correct remittance received, a Duplicate Certificate of Registration can be issued.</p>
          
          <p>Not withstanding anything contained herein the Council has the right to consider any application for the issue of a duplicate Certificate of Registration.</p>
          
          <h3>Microchipping</h3>
          <p>The AHAA requires all Spanish and Australian Andalusians to be micro-chipped.  These horses may also be branded according to AHAA branding rules at the owners discretion.  Partbred horses may be branded according to AHAA branding rules or micro-chipped, or both, at the owner’s discretion.  The microchip to be used is "Life chip" which is internationally recognized by all Associations of our breed.  Application to be made to the Secretary for micro-chips and relevant paperwork.  The Association will accept other brands of microchips provided a Veterinarian scans and identifies the said chip and completes the necessary paperwork.</p>
          
          <h3>Branding</h3>
          <p>Your horse, if Pure Spanish or Australian Andalusian, may be branded as well as microchipped.  Partbred horses must be either branded or micro-chipped, or both in accordance with AHAA rules.</p>
          
          <p>The requirements of this Association for branding are as follows:-</p>
          
          <p>Branding of horses must be with the *"foal drop number over the **season on the OFF SHOULDER.  MALES must have your registered stud brand on the NEAR THIGH.  FEMALES must have your registered stud brand on the OFF THIGH.  In conjunction with the breeder’s brand, identification symbols may be used, these being "S", "A", "1",  or "2". </p>
          
          <p>*The foal drop number is the number in sequence of your foals born in a season.  If it is your first foal born for that season, it is number 1, if it is your fourth it is number 4.</p>
          
          <p>** Season - The breeding season commences on August 1st and ends on July 31st of the following year, so if your foal is born in September, 2005 or March 2006, it is still born within the 2005 breeding season and should be branded with the foal drop over 5.</p>
          
          <p>All breeders must register with the Federal Secretary a branding symbol which does not contain the letters "A" or "S" or the numbers "1" or "2".  These symbols are reserved by the Association and must be used in conjunction with the Breeder’s symbol for purpose of identification.  </p>
          
          <h3>DNA Regulations</h3>
          <p>1.  Members will apply for DNA through the AHAA or AHAA recognized Laboratories on the appropriate application form.  Application forms may be obtained from the Federal Secretary.</p>
          
          <p>2.  Application forms for DNA testing will be returned to the Federal Secretary with a cheque for the amount of $90 made out the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>3.  An Identification form and collection bag will be returned to the owner and a registered veterinarian will take samples, complete the form and forward both to The University of Queensland.</p>
          
          <p>4.  There will be no retrospective Parentage Validation for horses DNA tested according to the regulations introduced in 1999.  Records will not be released to individuals but held in the office of the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>5.  All Pure Spanish breeding stallions to be DNA tested prior to the Stud Service Return being lodged.  Spanish mares being used for breeding to be DNA tested prior to Stud Service Return being lodged.</p>
          
          <p>6.  All Spanish foals born after 1/8/2003 must be DNA tested for Parentage Validation before registration.  Upon request of the owner, DNA test results for all Pure Spanish horses tested after the 1/8/03 may be forwarded to them or to a laboratory nominated by them.</p>
          
          <p>7.  Application for DNA Parentage Validation testing to prove identity of an animal for registration with the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia may be applied for through the office of the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>8.  The AHAA recognize any purebred stock from another country in the stud book provided that it is DNA tested and meets the criteria of the AHAA.</p>
          
          <p>From time to time third parties undertake DNA testing, but it is the policy of the Association to not do retrospective Parentage Validation and in circumstances where the Association becomes aware of rumours about third party testing but it does not have a veterinarian certificate certifying the taking of the sample in question, does not have proof of a chain of custody of that sample, and does not have full analysis undertaken by an authorised testing service it does not intend to make any statements or take any actions regarding those rumours.</p>
          
          <h3>Names</h3>
          <p>Registration of a horse under a particular name may be refused if the spelling or pronunciation of the name is in the opinion of the Council so like the name of another registered horse as to be likely to mislead whether or not a Stud Prefix or Suffix is included.</p>
          
          <p>Names of established Studs (whether in Australasia or elsewhere) or celebrated horses (whether in Australasia or elsewhere) may only be applied to a horse having some ancestral claim thereto and shall not be used if such use is in the opinion of the Council likely to be misleading whether or not a Stud Prefix or Suffix is included.</p>
          
          <p>Where the Registered Name of a horse cannot be accepted for registration by the EFA or similar organization and an alternate name must be used for such registration, the Owner is requested to return the Registration Certificate for the endorsement and recording of same.  The Association registered name must be used for all matters pertaining to the Association.</p>
          
          <p>Where the Registered Name of a horse includes a Stud Prefix or Suffix, owners are requested to refer to such a horse by it’s full registered name.</p>
          
          <p>Stud Prefixes or Suffixes to be used as part of a registered name must be registered with the Association prior to acceptance of registration of a horse incorporating same.</p>
          
          <p>The Association may refuse to allow the registration of any name, which in its absolute discretion it considers to be misleading, misapplied or contrary to the interests of the members of the Association generally.</p>
