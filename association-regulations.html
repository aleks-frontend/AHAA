          <p>2.   Effective November 2001, "The Federal Body of the AHAA shall be responsible for managing all active days run by the A H AA and shall be responsible for nominating sub‑committees to organise such days."</p>
          <p> 3.  Effective March 2002, "State Delegates should attend a minimum of 2 State Committee Meetings per year and receive notice of meetings and minutes."</p>
          <p> 4.  State Delegates, if unable to attend a Council Meeting, may appoint a suitable representative to appear in their place.  This representative may participate in all business at the said meeting but will not have voting rights.</p>
          <p> </p><h3><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></h3><p>Registration will only be accepted from Full Financial Members of the Association.  Each application for registration shall be submitted on the prescribed form and shall contain all such information and documentation as required by the AHAA.<br />   <br /> Each horse submitted for registration (excluding entry to the Iberian Derivative Register) must be the progeny of a Sire and/or Dam which are registered or eligible for registration at the date of application in the Stud Book of this Association or Stud Book or Register recognised by this Association.<br />   <br /> In respect of each horse (Pure Spanish, Australian and Partbred) foaled in Australia, application for registration in the Stud Books or Register of the AHAA shall be submitted within TWELVE (12) MONTHS from foaling.  Members applying for late registration of foals must pay the late fee and all paperwork must be received at the office of the AHAA prior to 1st August of the year the foal turns 2 years.  Horses foaled in Australia and recorded in overseas stud books, but not with the AHAA before the age of 2 years, will be ineligible for registration with the AHAA. </p>
          <p> </p><h3><strong> REGISTRATION OF HORSES FOALED IN AUSTRALIA AFTER THE ABOVE DATE WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE AHAA UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</strong></h3><p>If an application for registration of a horse is not correct or is incomplete, that application shall be returned for the correct completion and resubmission within thirty (30) days or  penalty fees become payable.<br />  <br /> In respect of each horse imported into Australasia, an application for registration in the Stud Book shall be made by its owner within sixty (60) days from its clearance from quarantine.  Each P.R.E. horse so imported must provide Certificate of Registration from the country of origin, be DNA tested and meet all criteria required by the Council of the AHAA.  Each horse so imported may be inspected for the purpose of verification of identity by one or more inspectors appointed for that purpose by the Council.</p><p> A foal born in Australia as a result of the use of imported semen may be registered in the AHAA Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses after it has been inscribed in the official Stud Book for Purebred Spanish Horses of Spain.  Inscription proof needs to be provided in the form of copies of all relevant inscription documents officially signed as sighted by the Secretary of  AHAA or a JP.  The words "I certify this is a true and unaltered copy of the original" with a signature and date would be required to be written on each page of the inscription documents.  The documents need to show all relevant information for the horse to be registered including (but not limited to) date of birth, identification diagrams, pedigree information, microchip number and parent DNA compatability.  The foal will need to be DNA profiled with the AHAA so the AHAA has records for future parent validation.</p><p> Not withstanding anything contained herein, the Council may insist upon the inspection of any horse before accepting the application for registration in the Stud Book or Register and may appoint one or more inspectors for that purpose and the expense of the inspection shall be borne by the applicant for registration.</p><p> A Certificate of Registration shall be issued in respect of each and every approved application for registration.</p><p> Under no circumstances shall the Certificate of Registration be amended, endorsed or mutilated in any way.

          <p> </p><h3><strong>NAMES  </strong></h3><p>Registration of a horse under a particular name may be refused if the spelling or pronunciation of the name is, in the opinion of the Council, so like the name of another registered horse as to be likely to mislead whether or not a Stud Prefix or Suffix is included.<br />   <br /> Names of established Studs (whether in Australasia or elsewhere) or celebrated horses (whether in Australasia or elsewhere) may only be applied to a horse having some ancestral claim thereto and shall not be used if such use is, in the opinion of the Council, likely to be misleading whether or not a Stud Prefix or Suffix is included.<br />   <br /> Where the Registered Name of a horse cannot be accepted for registration by the EFA or similar Organisation and an alternate name must be used for such registration, the Owner is requested to return the Registration Certificate for the endorsement and recording of same.  The Association registered name must he used for all matters pertaining to the Association.<br />   <br /> Where the Registered Name of a horse includes a Stud Prefix or Suffix, owners are requested to refer to such a horse by its full registered name.<br />   <br /> Stud Prefixes or Suffixes to be used as part of a Registered name must be registered with the Association prior to acceptance of registration of a horse incorporating same.<br />    <br /> The Association may refuse to allow the registration of any name which, in its absolute discretion, it considers to be misleading, misapplied or contrary to the interests of the members of the Association generally.  </p>

If the mare and stallion are present at the same stud, the stallion owner or his/her agent should also note the above details in the certificate of service form in the stallion`s book at the time of insemination.  If the semen is transported to the mare, however, a copy of the certificate mentioned in (5) (above) shall be forwarded to the stallion owner so that the service certificate book may be completed.  It is recommended that the white copy be forwarded to the mare owner only after a positive pregnancy diagnosis is made between 40 and 70 days after last insemination.</p><p> 7. Application for registration resulting from AI must be accompanied by the service certificate (white copy), the mare identification certificate (see 5 above), DNA result as well as the applicable registration form and fee.  (Note: All new foals must be recorded with the AHAA  within 12 months or penalty fees will apply.)</p><p> 8.

Application for DNA Parentage Validation testing to prove identity of an animal for registration with the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia may be applied for through the office of the AHAA.</p><p> 8. The AHAA recognises any purebred stock from another country in the stud book provided that it is DNA tested and meets the criteria of the AHAA.</p>
          <p>From time to time third parties undertake DNA testing, but it is the policy of the Association to not do retrospective Parentage Validation and in circumstances where the Association becomes aware of rumours about third party testing but it does not have a veterinarian certificate certifying the taking of the sample in question, does not have proof of a chain of custody of that sample, and does not have full analysis undertaken by an authorised testing service it does not intend to make any statements or take any actions regarding those rumours.</p>
          <p> </p><h3><strong>EMBRYO TRANSFER</strong></h3><p>Application may be made to the Council of the AHAA for embryo transfer with all relevant details and supporting veterinary documentation.  Council shall consider each case on its merits‑ Council approval may be given but will be limited to two (2) live (24hour) foals per mare only.</p>

          <p> </p><h3>DEATHS</h3><p>Notice of the death of a horse recorded by the Association shall be given by the registered owner or lessee to the Secretary within ninety (90) days upon the death of the horse and upon such notice being given, the death shall be recorded in the Stud Book or Register.  The Certificate of Registration must be returned to the Association for endorsement.  </p>

          <p> </p><h3><strong> BRANDING</strong></h3><p>Your horse, if Pure Spanish or Australian Andalusian, may be branded as well as microchipped.  Partbred horses must be either branded or microchipped, or both in accordance with AHAA rules.  The requirements of this Association for branding are as follows:‑</p><p> Branding of horses must be with the * foal drop number over the **season on the OFF SHOULDER. MALES must have your registered stud brand on the NEAR THIGH. FEMALES must have your registered stud brand on the OFF THIGH. In conjunction with the breeder s brand, identification symbols may be used, these being "S", A , "1" or "2 . Association brands are available free of charge from your State Secretary.</p><p> *The foal drop number is the number in sequence of your foals born in a season. If it is your first foal born for that season, it is number 1, if it is your fourth it is number 4.</p><p> ** Season ‑ the breeding season commences on August Ist and ends on July 31st, so if your foal is born in September, 2005 or March 2006, it is still born within the 2005 season, and should be branded with the foal drop over 5.</p><p> All breeders must register with the Federal Secretary a branding symbol which does not contain the letters "A or "S" or the numerals 1 or "2".  These symbols are reserved by the Association and must be used in conjunction with the Breeder`s symbol for purpose of identification.  The Association brand can be used but only in conjunction with the Breeders symbol.</p>
