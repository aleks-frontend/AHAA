          <p>Over the past month <em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Kate Fenner and her talented buckskin Iberian (Andalusian x Lusitano) gelding ‘Jazz’ </strong></span></em>left the peace and quiet<span> of country living and headed to the big smoke of Sydney to take part in a theatre production by Living Room Theatre - <strong>‘I Love Todd Sampson (redux)’</strong> a theatrical experience which integrates architecture, sound, film, equine science and performance to expose the vulnerability of human nature; A very successful production which has profoundly left it’s mark with positive feedback from social media sites, popular magazines and newspapers, with Jazz taking the limelight with his beautiful golden coat like a true star!</span></p>
          <p>It’s hard to believe Jazz recently celebrated his 5th birthday and up until a month ago was a colt. It goes without saying Kate has done a phenomenal job of training Jazz not only for his important role but also his development as a riding horse.</p>
          <p>Over the past few months Kate focused all her time and energy towards Jazz to ensure he was ready for his role and ensured it was done at his pace; Being a country kid Jazz had never experienced city life and was a bit stressed at the beginning but with reassurance and comfort from Kate he went above and beyond to please and by the time production started he was more than ready. I’m sure all the extra attention from the cast helped also!</p>
          <p>The production itself required Jazz to be still for long periods of time in front of a big audience in very confined spaces as well as walk quietly through crowds and around the block in Redfern - the middle of Sydney. Kate explains ‘Jazz was perfectly behaved in every way from start to finish - evidence that early foundation training really pays off’.</p>
          <p>Jazz was purchased as a yearling from <em>Noble Parque Stud</em> located in Tasmania; he is out of the Andalusian mare Noble Parque del Dabria (El Caballero Ambassador x Andauka Destinada) and by the Approved Lusitano stallion Saphiro via frozen semen. Kate has been the primary trainer of Jazz, using her program she created <em>‘Kandoo Club Foundation Training’</em>- a focus on groundwork and waiting until over 4 or mature enough both mentally and physically to begin work under saddle. Working with the Iberian breed Kate has found their temperaments are ‘perfect for creating safe and happy riding horses’.</p>
          <p>Jazz is currently under saddle up to his 12th ride and whilst staying in Sydney have been riding in the busy Centennial Park between production breaks!</p>
          <p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Congratulations Kate and Jazz on your fantastic promotion of the breed and we look forward to sharing future updates.</em></span></p>

          <h2 id="a16">Property Identification Code requirements for NSW horse owners</h2>
          <p><strong></strong>Dear Horse Industry representative, <br />
          <br />
          I wish to provide you with some important information about  extended requirements for property identification codes (PICs) in NSW. Please forward this information to your members and/or place it on your website so that your members can readily access this information and better understand the NSW PIC requirements. <br />
          <br />
          From 1 September 2012, all properties in NSW with one or more resident horses must have a PIC. <br />
          <br />
          Following the equine influenza (EI) outbreak in 2007, a task-force representing all major NSW horse industry groups (including racing, eventing, breed and show societies) recommended to Governments that PICs for horse properties be introduced. This decision was based on the recognition that it is essential in an emergency involving horses to know where horses are located. <br />
          <br />
          The initial response to EI was hampered by not knowing the location of horses, especially where there were high concentrations of horses.  It is likely that the disease would have been controlled more rapidly if we had been able to target areas with the highest density of horses for surveillance and vaccination. <br />
          <br />
          As a result of this industry consensus, the Chief Veterinary Officers from all jurisdictions agreed in 2008 that PICs should be mandatory for properties with one or more horses. <br />
          <br />
          In 2009, the Australian Horse Industry Council (AHIC) strongly expressed its support for the introduction of PICs for properties where horses are kept to the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI). <br />
          <br />
          PICs are a well-established national system of property registration used by all States and Territories for other livestock. Many horse properties would already have a PIC as they run other livestock or pay rates to Livestock Health and Pest Authorities (LHPAs). Extending PICs to all horse properties makes low-cost use of existing administrative systems and databases. <br />
          <br />
          The introduction of a PIC system for horse properties brings NSW into line with Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory which already have this requirement. <br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Please note that the introduction of PICs for horse properties DOES NOT mean that horses will be subject to any requirements of the National Livestock Identification Scheme (NLIS).</em></strong> <strong><em>It is not mandatory</em></strong> <strong><em>to supply a PIC before a horse can be bought, sold or moved, nor record the horse’s movement on the NLIS database.</em></strong>  However, it would be good practice for horse owners to keep a diary or other record of where their horse has been, which ideally would include the PIC of the property or event ground. <br />
          <br />
          In time, sections of the horse industry, as part of a biosecurity risk mitigation strategy, may require entrants to provide the PIC of the property the horse normally resides on when attending an event. This has already been introduced in Queensland and for some events in Victoria. It is this industry requirement that is expected to encourage the uptake of PICs for horse properties in NSW.  It is not the intention of NSW DPI or LHPAs to enforce compliance from September 1 and we expect that industry will encourage compliance over time as best practice. <br />
          <br />
          The requirement for PICs for horse properties has been introduced primarily for the benefit and protection of the horse industry. The NSW Minister for Primary Industries has recently written to the AHIC thanking them for their strong support for the introduction of PICs for horse properties and requested that their support for PICs be conveyed to NSW AHIC members. NSW is the state with the largest horse population and possibly the largest economic impact if another disease outbreak occurred, so biosecurity measures such as PICs increases the knowledge and contact with the horse industry, which is a positive step. <br />
          <br />
          Property and horse owners can apply for a PIC by contacting their local <a href="http://www.lhpa.org.au/districts">Livestock Health and Pest Authority</a>, or <a href="https://customerportal.lhpa.org.au/pic-registration/">applying on line</a>.  More information is also available in the <a href="http://www.lhpa.org.au/identifying-and-tracing-livestock/property-identification-codes/faqhorse-owners">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for horse owners on the LHPA website. I also attach a brochure which may be of assistance to your members and which could be published on your website or forwarded by email. <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for your association’s support and interest in enhanced biosecurity for the horse industries. <br />
          <br />
          Yours sincerely <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Ian Roth</strong> <br />
          <strong>Chief Veterinary Officer of NSW</strong></p>
